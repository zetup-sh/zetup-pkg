### Custom

You can add onto any dot files (tmux.conf, fns.sh, aliases.sh, bashrc.sh, or vimrc) in this file. Note there is not actually a dot at the beginning of the file name.

Custom does not replace this repository's built in file. If you want to completely replace this repository's built in file, use the `custom` directory.

This is undoable by simply deleting the file.

NOTE: You will need to remove this directory from `.gitignore` if you want to save this file to your repository.

You can also put anything in here that you want to take along with your for your installation.
